# Network-security-with-traffic-analysis
üõ°Ô∏è ADVANCED AI NETWORK SECURITY TRAFFIC ANALYZER ‚Äì THEORY DESCRIPTION

### OVERVIEW
This project is an interactive, AI-powered web application designed for network traffic analysis and security threat detection. It leverages advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze network flow data, identify anomalies, classify traffic patterns, and assess potential threats in real-time. The tool is built using Streamlit, enabling a user-friendly interface for cybersecurity analysts, researchers, and network administrators.

### KEY FEATURES

1. DATA UPLOAD & SMART ANALYSIS

Upload network traffic datasets in CSV format.

Automatic detection of required features (e.g., duration, packet counts, bytes).

Generate insights on traffic volume, packet behavior, and connection patterns.

Visual analytics including heatmaps, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

2. AI TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION

Train classifiers such as Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Automatically evaluates model performance and selects the best one.

Supports training on labeled datasets and outputs accuracy and confusion matrix.

3. ADVANCED ANOMALY DETECTION

Implements multiple unsupervised detection techniques:

Isolation Forest

DBSCAN clustering

Statistical anomaly detection (Z-score)

Highlights outliers and suspicious flows.

Provides consensus-based anomaly flagging.

4. BEHAVIORAL PATTERN ANALYSIS

Uses clustering (K-Means + PCA) to segment flows into behavioral groups.

Provides average flow statistics per cluster.

Temporal analysis if timestamp data is available.

5. REAL-TIME THREAT ASSESSMENT

Allows users to input live traffic parameters.

Performs:

Threat scoring using AI heuristics.

Classification and anomaly detection using trained models.

Outputs a dynamic risk level: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH.

Provides security recommendations and behavioral warnings.
